<p>Josh K. first started trading Binary Options and FX in 2005, while he has been offering education via BlueSkyBinary since 2014. He is a specialist in mean reversion strategies with excellent money management skills and emotion control.</p>
<p>After an 8-year professional career in major financial institutions like JP Morgan (London) and Goldman Sachs (London) in the equities division, Josh decided to take his knowledge of the financial markets and apply it to binary options and FX more methodically. Therefore, he built a team of financial engineers and traders around him and started developing new technologies for binary options and FX with the purpose of educating traders around the world on how to trade in a safer, more responsible and overall better way following market fundamentals. This is how BlueSkyBinary, the largest binary options education and technology group, was created.</p>
