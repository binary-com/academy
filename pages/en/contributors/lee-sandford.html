<p>Following an 18-year career in professional football, Lee has now been trading for some 17 years (full time for 11 years). He established Trading College in response to demand from other traders wishing to observe him trading.</p>
<p>Interrupted frequently with calls from people wishing to learn how to trade, Lee started by helping friends (and soon friends of friends) to understand the basic principles of trading. The early demand was sufficient to require a group course, and these soon grew into the organization as we know it today.</p>
<p>Lee believes that to have a chance at becoming highly successful traders and achieve stress-free trading, one must first master the tools at his or her disposal. His aim is to get traders of all levels to generate a consistent income from trading the markets, by recognizing patterns that repeat themselves. Once they learn these patterns then it is all about putting on the trade. Lee speaks regularly at trade shows, finance events, corporate functions and private wealth events. Renowned for his straight talking approach to trading, he is respected by some of the largest trading companies in the UK.</p>
