<p>Theo Patsios has been trading the Forex market since 2005 and providing Forex trading education since 2008. He is a specialist in Pure Price Action Trading with solid Risk:Reward, Trade and Money Management.</p>
<p>After a couple of years of trading the Forex market, Theo wanted to share what he had learnt about trading online. He first started posting his discoveries about Forex trading at various Forex forums online. His posts became very popular among traders and he decided to start a blog in an effort to have a more focused place where he could teach his trading strategies. Theo’s blog became more popular than he expected and so he set out to create his own website in 2009 - ElectroFX.com. Theo nowadays holds daily Forex trading sessions via his own ElectroFX Live Room, available via his website.</p>
