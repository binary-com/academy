        After completing his degrees in finance and economics & politics, Chris Svorcik devoted his time to learning the trade of trading. He studied hard to master the theory and practical implementation of technical analysis on the charts. In his most recent
        work Chris has been examining the relationship between moving averages, price action, and especially time. Chris now trades full-time after he took the leap of leaving his day job in the spring of 2011. Besides his contributions to the WinnersEdge
        blog, Chris also teaches technical analysis in webinars and seminars.abcde
