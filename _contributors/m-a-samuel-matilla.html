    <p>M.A. Samuel Matilla is a maverick who in 2008 (at the height of the global financial crisis) left a successful career in the electrical engineering field to begin a career trading the global currency & equity markets. </p>


    <p>Samuel was mentored by a very successful private equity trader who drilled in him the importance of sound risk management and who taught him how to integrate both fundamental & technical analysis to analyse current market trends and to determine where the markets are headed. </p>

</div>

	<p>Samuel’s analytical style of thinking and sense of timing proved to be well suited for trading the markets. He increased his initial client portfolio in his first 3 months of trading and quickly gained the respect and trust of his superiors, family and friends. By 2011 Samuel had enough capital & experience to co-found IIG Ltd., a private proprietary trading firm based in West Africa.</p>

	<p>Together with partners from the UK & US, Samuel established <i>The International Traders Institute (ITI)</i>, the premier trading education hub in West Africa.</p>

	<p>Samuel is currently the Head of Training at ITI and has himself personally trained & mentored some of West Africa's best and brightest talent. Some of ITI’s alumni have gone on to work for Hedge Funds and many are self directed proprietary traders.</p>
