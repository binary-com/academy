        Dave Evans is a market analyst and an editor of financial publications. His commentary has appeared in various publications from City AM to the Dow Jones newswire. His background is in psychology and previously practiced as a psychotherapist. He believes
        that as just as individuals can show mental bias when it comes to money, financial markets can show similar bias at certain extremes. Dave blends technicals with fundamental and political analysis on forex markets, while taking a primarily quantitative
        approach to trading stock markets.
