    <p>Gradually, he started sharing his knowledge with his friends and he realized that even those with very little education in finance were able to understand him and achieve positive trading results. As a result, he believed that larger crowds could benefit from his training and experience. It was during this time that he decided to leave his medical practice behind and to start conducting seminars in investment and financial trading to residents of Saudi Arabia and the UAE with occasional seminars in Cairo, Egypt.
