    	Binary Options Trading System In A Diary 2015
    </h2>
    <p>Vernon has just recently published a new e-book entitled, “Binary options trading system in a dairy 2015.”</p>
    <p>The diary is based on Vernon Lees' daily, weekly and monthly analysis which he conducts across a range of financial instruments, including Forex, Indices and Commodities on an annual basis. It provides an “automatic” binary options trading system which is based on historic mathematical probabilities. It highlights trading opportunities where there is a high probability chance of winning*.</p>
    <p>Vernon Lees says, “although this diary is not my core trading strategy, I have been compiling, sharing and trading this high probability trading system since 2008. It is so simple to trade and time efficient that I use it to complement my other trading strategies.</p>
    <p>The analysis in this diary allows me to identify high probability weekly and monthly trading opportunities up to 12 months in advance. This helps me to plan my trading, effectively setting it on autopilot."</p>
