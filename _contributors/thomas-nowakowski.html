        Thomas was appointed as a Senior Analyst at <a href="http://www.marketsandyou.com/">Markets And YOU</a> in 2014. His extensive background in trading, finance and risk management was what landed him the position with the leading binary index trading company. </p>
        <p>HHe was born in Europe, brought up in the United States and has now settled in Australia.  He is a man of true international background and it’s therefore no wonder that he specializes in FOREX and Binary Option Indices - markets that are driven by international news.

Anyone with a computer, internet access, an online brokerage account and proper guidance can change their economic status right at home, from anywhere on the planet.

    <h2>Advice From Thomas</h2>
    <p>Forecasting market movements is not a science that can be purely derived through mathematical means. Chaotic elements are also present in the ultimate market movement equation such as – earthquakes, tsunamis, accidents, wars, political events, release of economic data, political statements. Moreover, fear and greed are the dominant emotions driving markets with no mathematical yardsticks to measure the amounts at play, nor existing logic behind them. However, such sentiment must also be accounted for.  While part of the answer may be found in technical charting,  it’s the rest of the answer that’s elusive and that is exactly what <a href="http://www.marketsandyou.com/">MarketsAndYou</a>  focuses on.</p>
