    <h2>Advice From Thomas</h2>
    <p>Forecasting market movements is not a science that can be purely derived through mathematical means. Chaotic elements are also present in the ultimate market movement equation such as – earthquakes, tsunamis, accidents, wars, political events, release of economic data, political statements. Moreover, fear and greed are the dominant emotions driving markets with no mathematical yardsticks to measure the amounts at play, nor existing logic behind them.</p>
    
    <p>Reading Market Sentiment and attaining Emotional Maturity in trading, is the appropriate response to inherent market's random movements. Emotional elements of trading can only be learned by trading experience, ideally in environment under guidelines of an experienced professional trader. </p>
