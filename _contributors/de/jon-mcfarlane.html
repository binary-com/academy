        Jon McFarlane began investing when he received a piece of advice from a well known industry figure whilst working for a big clearing house in the city. It was don't trust anyone with your retirement funds - Learn the markets, know your markets, invest only where you want YOUR money to be invested. </p>

    <p>He took this advice to heart and has successfully managed his own PEP/ISA Investment portfolio ever since. Whilst keen on fundamental data for investing purposes there was also a level of exposure to Price charts, in particular Long-term ones. This led to an interest in Technical (Chart) Analysis and shorter term "trading". So, as a hobby, and for supplementary income he turned his eye to trading, albeit on a part-time basis. Based on the Investment returns on his portfolio and his satisfactory Trading results Jon decided to give up the "rat-race" in 2005 and take up trading on a full-time basis.

    <p>This Trading success was based not just on Traditional trading (Long & Short) but also on Financial Fixed Odds trading, the latter an area he still has a great deal of involvement in. In 2008 Jon persuaded a number of other traders he had gotten to know over the years to help him set up <a href="http://systemsfortraders.com/">Systems For Traders</a>. </p>

    <p>Now, as well as managing his own Investment portfolio and Trading for income he and his colleagues share their knowledge and experience via this site. It provides unbiased reviews of the many different Trading strategies & Signal services in this growing market and has already become a much respected source on the subject. </p>
    <p>
    	Jon tells us that for Financial Fixed Odds trading, Binary.com is the only platform he uses. His input to this guide is such that he hopes to share some of his experience and encourage others to take some of the steps he himself took in relation to understanding and learning Financial Fixed Odds.
