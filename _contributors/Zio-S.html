    <p>Having an engineering and mathematical background, Zio decided to take his structured
way of thinking and to apply it to his passion, binary options, more methodically. Therefore, he joined a team of financial engineers and traders and started developing new technologies for binary options and FX with the purpose of educating traders around the world on how to trade in a safer, more responsible and overall better way following market fundamentals. This group grew into BlueSkyBinary, one of the largest binary options education and technology group.</p>
