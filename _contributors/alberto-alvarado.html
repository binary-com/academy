    <p>Alberto Alvarado is a self-made professional trader based in Mexico City with more than 10 years of experience in financial trading. He started trading in 2005 with a Swiss Forex broker. The learning curve for Alberto was a lengthy and difficult one as he spent the first two years trying to master the right approach to trading the financial markets. </p> </div>

	<p>By 2007 he started gradually reaping the rewards of his efforts, only to see his capital evaporate in 2008 as a result of the high volatility crisis that the markets experienced during this same year. </p>
	<p>As a result, Alberto decided to change his approach completely to trading and started trading from scratch with a new mindset. Alberto has now developed his very own intuitive methods and creative approach to determine market trends by focusing mainly on price action trading and chart analysis using basic indicators like the MACD, Stochastic or RSI. </p>
	<p>He has spent years learning about price action trading strategies and heâ€™d now like to share these strategies with new traders in an effort to reduce their learning curve and to help them achieve their goals.
