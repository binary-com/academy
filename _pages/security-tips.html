<h1>Security Tips</h1>
<p>Here at <a href="http://blog.binary.com/en/online-security-tips/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=SecurityTips
">Binary.com</a> we take that extra step to protect you. Here are a few guidelines to secure your data and to stay safe online:</p>

<ul class="bullet">

    <li>Don't click links in suspicious emails, SMSes, or pop-ups. Always type the web address yourself. The correct URL is www.binary.com<img class="img-center" src="/images/SECTIP-1.png" alt="security tips from Binary.com"></li>
    
    
    <li>Never share valuable information such as your Login ID and password via emails, texts or phone calls.<img class="img-center" src="/images/SECTIP-2.png" alt="security tips from Binary.com"></li>
    
    <li>Never respond to unsolicited promotional emails. If in doubt, just delete the email.<img class="img-center" src="/images/SECTIP-3.png" alt="security tips from Binary.com"></li>
    

    <li>Check out the padlock icon on your browser. This icon indicates that the website uses a secure connection.<img class="img-center" src="/images/SECTIP-4.png" alt="security tips from Binary.com"></li>
        

    <li>Invest in computer security such as a personal firewall, anti-spyware, or anti-virus software. Update this software regularly!<img class="img-center" src="/images/SECTIP-5.png" alt="security tips from Binary.com"></li>
        

    <li>Share your e-mail address with only trusted sources. Only your family, friends, and trusted business contacts should have your personal e-mail address. Do not post your e-mail address on forums, or in public chat rooms.</li>
    <li>Use Separate Email Accounts. Imagine if you could consolidate all of your work emails into a single work account and all of your personal communications with your personal account, and a throwaway account for potential spam links. This way, if someone hacks your work account, all of your personal emails are still safe or vice versa.</li>
    <li>Create smart and strong passwords. Make it difficult for hackers to crack your password. You may create a smart password by incorporating capital letters, numbers, special characters and using more than six characters.</li>
</ul>
