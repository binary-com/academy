Great news! Touch/No Touch trades on selected Indices are now available with a minimum duration of 1 day. The flexibility of choosing a duration as little as 1 day puts you further in control, giving you a broader range of options when purchasing your trade.

The new short-term trades are now available on the Australian, Hong Kong, UK and Wall Street Indices.
