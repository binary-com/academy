To complete our series of Random Indices, we have now launched the Random Mars and the Random Venus. The Random Mars simulates a market that is active during the day (but becomes less volatile at night) and the Random Venus simulates a market that is quiet during the day (but becomes more volatile at night). Both these indices reset back to a price of 1000 at 12:00PM GMT every day.

For more information about the different Random Markets available, [feel free to refer to our Random Markets page](https://www.binary.com/get-started/random-markets?l=EN&utm_medium=social&utm_source=blog&utm_content=whatsnew).
