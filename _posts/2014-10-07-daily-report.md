The dollar index is steadying itself after experiencing the biggest sell off from its current run yesterday. This morning, the dollar is steady as traders wait for the main morning data to come through. The S&P 500 is still on the back foot however.

Gold and silver are on the rise as traders play  the rebound and caution overtakes greed. 

Elsewhere, the AUD/USD is dropping after the Australian Statistics Burreau said it may have to revise recent employment figures.

Coming up today: 
Coming up today we have US crude oil inventories at 15.30, but the main ticket today is the release of the minutes from the last FOMC meeting.
Trade Idea: 
The AUD/JPY downtrend may have stalled, but the longer term movement remains negative. With the yen threatening to recover, there could be further downside from here.

[A good way to play this could be a LOWER trade predicting that the AUD/JPY will close below 95.00 in 5 days time for a potential return of 109% if successful. ](#)
This is presented as an idea to stimulate fixed odds financial betting ideas and is not financial advice.
