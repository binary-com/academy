Seasons greetings, traders!

We would like to inform you about certain trade restrictions that will be in effect during the holiday period, due to a reduced volume of trades worldwide.

**Trade restrictions have now been placed on Stock and Index contracts with a duration of one day or more.**

Please select an expiry date after January 5th to proceed with the purchase of such contracts.
Thanks as always for trading with [Binary.com](https://www.binary.com/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=social&utm_content=en&utm_campaign=whatsnew)! Happy holidays!
