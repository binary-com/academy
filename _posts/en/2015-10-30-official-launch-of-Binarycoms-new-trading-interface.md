We’re very proud to announce the formal launch of a [streamlined trading interface on the Binary.com website](https://www.binary.com/) which will be rolled out this week.  

We first introduced this interface in beta form during [early September](https://www.binary.com/). We have been working diligently to refine it ever since.

**Explore the Many Benefits**

You’ll notice that this new platform offers a number of significant advantages over the previous version.  Most notably:

1. **A Simplified Main Menu.**  Dive straight into the instrument and underlying category of your choice – all with just one click from the main dropdown menu, located at the top left of the new interface. 
2. **Instantaneous Pricing Updates.**  Switch from market to market with effortless ease. Whenever you select a new variable, the pricing on the right updates automatically – thanks to the platform’s powerful new engine on Websocket, the industry’s leading technological standard.
3. **Cleaner, More Responsive Design.**  Spend less time clicking, and more time trading.  No matter which device you prefer to use at any given moment – desktop, mobile, or tablet – you’ll find it all equally convenient, based on the streamlined set of features and further-improved responsive design.

**Take Note of the Changes**

To support these enhancements, you’ll notice that we’ve switched the position of a few familiar features.  Specifically:

1. **The market options previously found in the sub-navigation menu have now been moved into the main dropdown menu,** for a cleaner look and much swifter convenience.
2. **The two underlying fields also have been shifted into the main menu** – with just one simple click needed to select your preference.
3. **The “Get Prices” button has been removed altogether,** since pricing now uploads instantaneously, based on all of the variables selected.
