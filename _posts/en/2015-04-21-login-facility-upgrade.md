Binary.com will soon be upgrading the login facility on its website in an effort to conform to prevailing standards and industry practices. Once changes come into effect, in order to access your account, you will only need to insert the email address that you registered with your account when you first signed up. You will no longer be required to access your account using your login ID.

If you have a real money account or a virtual money account registered with Binary.com, simply insert your email address as well as the relevant password, depending on which of the two accounts you'd like to access. 

If you have signed up for both a real money account and a virtual account using the same email address, you will be required to access your account using the email address and your real money account password. 

Should you require assistance, feel free to contact our customer support team at [helpdesk@binary.com](mailto:helpdesk@binary.com).
