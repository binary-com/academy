Last week, we launched Bitcoin (BTC) currency accounts that allow you to fund your account, buy contracts, and collect your payouts –– all in BTC.

#### Today, we’re excited to announce our latest cryptocurrency account: Litecoin (LTC).

Litecoin is known as the “silver” to Bitcoin’s “gold” and operates on the same principles: as a global, decentralised currency that lets you send payments anywhere in the world at near-zero cost.

Both cryptocurrencies are well-known for their minimal transaction cost and enhanced security. However, the Litecoin network was built to handle a higher transaction volume than Bitcoin, giving you faster transaction confirmation times.

Don’t worry, you’ll still have access to your regular fiat money account, whether it’s in USD, GBP, EUR, or AUD.
