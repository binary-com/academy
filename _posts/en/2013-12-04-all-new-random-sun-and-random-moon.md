With the latest upgrade to our trading platform, you now get to trade on two new Random Quotidians: the Random Sun and the Random Moon.

The Random Sun simulates a market that gets more volatile as the day progresses (and then more quiet at night). The Random Moon simulates a market that is quiet during the day (but becomes more volatile at night). These new Random Quotidians are reset back to a price of 1000 at the start of each trading day at 00:00:00 GMT.

For more information about the different Random Markets available, feel free to refer to [our brand new Random Markets page](https://www.binary.com/get-started/random-markets?l=EN&utm_medium=social&utm_source=blog&utm_content=whatsnew).

The Random Sun and the Random Moon are available immediately for trading and may be accessed via the Randoms section under Quotidians.
