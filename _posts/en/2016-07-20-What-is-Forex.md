What is Forex? Today, we’re going to explain a little about what Forex is and how it works from a trading perspective.

Forex is shorthand for “foreign exchange market.” This is a global market for buying, selling and exchanging currencies. 

Even though lots of large, international banks use Forex, it is actually the largest market in the world where anyone can be a trader.

Sometimes, Forex can help international trade by allowing currency conversion. So, if someone in the United States needs to import something from Europe, they can pay Euros, even though their income is in US dollars.

One great thing about Forex is that trading is open 24 hours a day, but it is closed on weekends. That means, you don’t have to wait for the market to open during the week, because it is always open!
