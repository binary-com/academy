“What Is Binary Options Trading?”**

<span style="color:grey">
***Welcome to Binary.com!***
</span>

<span style="color:grey">
***But what is “Binary Options Trading”?***
</span>

<span style="color:grey">
*It’s a special type of online trading with a fixed payout, in which you predict the outcome from two possible results.*
</span>


<span style="color:grey">
*The word “Binary” in Binary Options Trading comes from the choice of two potential outcomes, in a perfectly clear-cut, dual-sided scenario.*
</span>

<span style="color:grey">
***For example:***
</span>

<span style="color:grey">
*Will the price of Gold trade higher than the current spot price in 15 days?*
</span>


<span style="color:grey">
***No matter how you slice this scenario, there are only two outcomes possible:***
</span>

<span style="color:grey">
*-Yes, it will trade HIGHER.*
<br>
</span>

<span style="color:grey">
*-Or no, it will trade LOWER.*
</span>


<span style="color:grey">
***Let’s just say that you take the position that it will trade HIGHER, and decide to purchase this option:***
</span>

<span style="color:grey">
*-If your prediction is correct at the end of the set period, you’ll receive the payout that was determined at the start of the trade. Note that this amount is automatically calculated and reported to you through Binary.com’s pricing technology, before you even press the button to purchase this trade.*
</span>

<span style="color:grey">
*-If your prediction is incorrect at the end of the set period, you’ll only lose your initial stake, and no more. Note that the stake is equal to the amount that you initially pay to purchase the trade – so there are absolutely no surprises.*
</span>

<span style="color:grey">
*Thus, as you can see, Binary Options Trading is a very easy form of online trading, with entirely predictable outcomes.*
</span>

<span style="color:grey">
*With Binary.com, you know exactly what you stand to gain or lose before purchasing each and every trade.*
</span>

<span style="color:grey">
*There are never any hidden fees or commission; what you see is precisely what you get.*
</span>

<span style="color:grey">
*And you can jump in and start trading with as little as **$5!***
</span>
