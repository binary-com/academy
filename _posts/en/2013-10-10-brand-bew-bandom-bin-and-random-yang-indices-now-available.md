Due to high demand, we have now launched two new indices: the Random Yin and Random Yang.  These new indices are equivalent to the Random Bear & Random Bull indices, except that the Random Yin and Random Yang reset at 12:00PM GMT each day, whereas the Random Bull and Bear reset at 00:00AM GMT.

These new indices are particularly appealing to Asian and Oceania clients because they reset around the time that the Asian and Oceania markets open.

The Random Yin simulates a pessimistic market where downward movements are prevalent. The Random Yang simulates an optimistic market that typically trends upwards.

The Random Yin and Random Yang are available immediately for trading and may be accessed via the [Randoms section under Nocturnes](https://www.binary.com/).
