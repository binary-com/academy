Today marked the rollout of some changes to the signup process on [Binary.com](https://www.binary.com/?l=EN&utm_source=social&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=text&utm_campaign=whatsnew). 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Email verification is now required for the setup of all new virtual money accounts.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- It is not required again for upgrade to a real money account.
<br>
<br>


**A Quick Guide to the New Signup Process**

As you’ll now notice on our home page, an email address is first requested to sign up for a virtual account: 

![Binary Options Trading]({{ site.url }}/images/newsignup-1-2016.png)

Once your email address has been entered, check your inbox for a new message from us, to verify this address. 

Click on the link in the verification email, which will launch the following signup screen: 

![Binary.com]({{ site.url }}/images/newsignup-2-2016.png)

Complete the details in this form, and then you’ll be all set up to start trading with virtual money.

Whenever you’re ready to upgrade to a real money account, the process is simple; email verification is not required again.

**Password Meter Also Introduced**

To ensure that strong passwords are set, so that all of your personal details are properly safeguarded, we’ve also added a password meter to the site.
This password meter is now in effect for: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- All new virtual and real money account signups
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Password changes 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Cashier section passwords
<br>

Thanks as always for maintaining a trading account with [Binary.com](https://www.binary.com/?l=EN&utm_source=social&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=text&utm_campaign=whatsnew)!
