We are excited to announce that most major FX pairs now have upgraded feeds with smaller pip sizes. These selected FX pairs will now be quoted out to 5 decimal digits instead of 4. For example, the EUR/AUD was quoted as 1.4567, now it is quoted as 1.45678.

With these smaller pip sizes you will be able to see trends more clearly, time trades more precisely, and take advantage of even the smallest market movements.
