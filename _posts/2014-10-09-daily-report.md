This morning, the dollar index is back on top and dominating currency flows. This follows yesterdayâ€™s strong performance from the S&P 500, helped by better than expected new home sales.

Gold and silver are on the rise as traders play  the rebound and caution overtakes greed. 

Elsewhere, the AUD/USD is dropping after the Australian Statistics Burreau said it may have to revise recent employment figures.

Coming up today: 
Coming up today we have US crude oil inventories at 15.30, but the main ticket today is the release of the minutes from the last FOMC meeting.
Trade Idea: 
The AUD/JPY downtrend may have stalled, but the longer term movement remains negative. With the yen threatening to recover, there could be further downside from here.

[A good way to play this could be a LOWER trade predicting that the AUD/JPY will close below 95.00 in 5 days time for a potential return of 109% if successful. ](#)
This is presented as an idea to stimulate fixed odds financial betting ideas and is not financial advice.
